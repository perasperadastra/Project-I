## Input parameters. <a name = "parameters"></a>

**If not specified, all the units are in reduced units**

The number of unit cells that are simulated is choosed in the **nc** parameters, 

The density have units of (particles / reduced units of distances), take special care in avoid density greater than 0.6 .

The dimension parameters can't be changed in this version.

Can be generated three type of lattice: Simple cubic (=1), face cubic centered (=2), diamond (=3). Also it will be implemented a read from file subroutine in the next version.

Temperature is in kelvin units.

At **tmelt** parameter you can decide some initial steps that initialize the system, represents the time steps of melting the initial structure.

For reproducibility you can decide a seed for the random number generator that are inside of the software. Remember to be consistent with the seed you use.

The initial velocities of the particles can be setted up to 0 or to a bimodal distribution. To choose use the **vel_opt** parameter (= 1, bimodal) (= 0, zero initial velocities).

The integrated algorithms can be the Velocity Verlet with thermostat (= 1) or without thermostat (= 0). 

To control de time step change the **dt** parameter (in ps units) less than 0.01 ps make in the simulation unstable. The number of steps that will be computed is selected in the **ntimes** parameter. 

The output information frequency is controlled by the **everyt** parameter. AVOID HIGH RATES OF PRINTIN!!! Printing is a limiting stage in this software.

The **rc** parameter represents the cut-off of the forces calculation, at higher cut-off better precision but higher times of calculation.

At last, you must choose the parameters for the force-field ([Lennard-Jones](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potencial_de_Lennard-Jones) type). **σ** is the distance to the zero potential point in hte potential and **ε** is the depth of the potential well.
